Allows administrators to set minimum password strength requirements for their WooCommerce user accounts.

== Description ==

##Description##

Introduced in recent versions of WooCommerce, there is an integrated Password Strength Meter which forces users to use strong passwords. Sometimes this isn't desirable - with this plugin, you can choose between five password levels ranging from "Anything Goes" to "Strong Passwords Only".


= Notes =

This plugin was created and tested using WordPress 4.5.3. No guarantee provided - please use the plugin with caution. If you experience any issues, please [let the developer know](https://github.com/DanielSantoro/wc-password-strength-settings).

While this does allow for user accounts to have weaker passwords, it's a good idea to still encourage strong password use - _especially_ for administrators!

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin & install it to your `wp-content/plugins` folder (or use the Plugins menu through the WordPress Administration section)
2. Activate the plugin
3. Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Accounts** and edit the field at the bottom.
4. Save and enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: What does each level do? =
A: The five levels range from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). As passwords are typed, the strength meter will dynamically update - this will disable the "Sign Up" button until the requirements have been met.

= Q: Where does this show up? =
A: This should appear wherever the Password Strength Meter appears - in the "My Account" page or during Checkout.

= Q: Where can I go if I find an issue? =
A: You can submit a new issue on the [Public GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DanielSantoro/wc-password-strength-settings).

= Q: Dang, this is pretty awesome. Where can I see some of your other stuff? =
A: Check out the developer's personal site at [DanielSantoro.com](http://danielsantoro.com).
