Allows administrators to set minimum password strength requirements for their WooCommerce user accounts.

== Description ==

##Description##

Introduced in recent versions of WooCommerce, there is an integrated Password Strength Meter which forces users to use strong passwords. Sometimes this isn't desirable - with this plugin, you can choose between five password levels ranging from "Anything Goes" to "Strong Passwords Only". In addition, you can modify the colors and appearance of these custom messages, as well as modify or remove the password hint.

= What's New? =
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

As of plugin version 1.1.0, you can change the messaging that appears as a user is typing through custom fields. Special thanks to Rynaldo for making this possible!
>>>>>>> origin/master

As of plugin version 1.2.0, you can now change the styling of the custom messages that appear when a user is entering their password. Additionally, you can now edit or remove the Password Hint generated by WooCommerce. As usual, heavy lifting done by Rynaldo while Danny screws around and only occasionally figures something out. :)

While this does allow for user accounts to have weaker passwords, it's a good idea to still encourage strong password use - _especially_ for administrators!

= Planned Features =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: What does each level do? =
A: The five levels range from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). As passwords are typed, the strength meter will dynamically update - this will disable the "Sign Up" button until the requirements have been met.

= Q: How is the password strength determined? =
A: The password strength is determined by WordPress core, more specifically using a library called "zxcvbn", created by Dropbox. There's a more in-depth description of how this works in the [plugin documentation](https://danielsantoro.com/project/woocommerce-password-strength-settings-plugin/?utm_source=pw-strength-plugin&utm_medium=plugin-readme).

= Q: Where does this show up? =
A: This should appear wherever the Password Strength Meter appears - in the "My Account" page or during Checkout.

= Q: Where can I go if I find an issue or want to recommend a feature? =
